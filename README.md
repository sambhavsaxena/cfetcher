# Cfetcher

Cfetcher is a cross platform application written and bundled with React-native that fetches the upcoming contests on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com).
Each time the application renders, a request is sent to the codeforces API that lists the upcoming and ongoing contests.

## Installation

Follow the steps to get started:

* Fork and clone [this](https://github.com/sambhavsaxena/cfetcher) repository to make an instant copy of the content.
* Alternatively, you can download the source and set it up with Github Desktop.
* There are two ways that follows, either to use a [third party service](https://expo.dev/) or,
* To install the entire Android + iOS development environment on the machine. 

To try out a faster and more flexible way, continue with the following process:

* Install the `react-native`, `expo` and `eas` command-line interfaces that combines the features that comes with React dev environment.
* Run the following commands in the project directory:
```
 npm install
 npm start
```

A metro debugger would launch up and start debugging the processes in the background. In case it does not, consider visiting [this](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/11/01/eli5-metro-javascript-bundler-react-native/) page.

The other way is to follow the fully fledged process that includes installing JDK, Android Studio, SDK, AVD, Gradle and other environment platforms that supports the development of Android apps.

To follow this, consider walking through the [official](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) documentation.

## to-do

Configure the application to set alarms every time a new contest pops up. We could also consider sending local push notifications, to start with.
[This](https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification#readme) might help getting started with the idea.
